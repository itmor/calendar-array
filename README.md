### Description of public methods
### getCalendar(Array<Number>.....);
If you want to get the whole year with all months, just pass in an array whose first element will be a year of a numeric type.
- #### .getCalendar([2019]);

If you want to receive only certain months, indicate their index after the year.
- #### .getCalendar([2019, 1, 2, 5, 12]);


You can get several years at once by simply passing arrays as many times as necessary, as a result you get an object that will be several years old.
- #### .getCalendar([2007], [2020], [2090, 4, 6, 7]);
