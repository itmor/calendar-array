I'm a developer from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦  
Russia started a war, invaded my country, destroyed the entire infrastructure of my city, kills civilians and drops bombs on residential areas.
I live in the city of Kherson. and I am under occupation, these Russian pigs do not allow humanitarian corridors to pass.  
They kill and starve the inhabitants.
Here are shots of what they are doing to our cities

Russians are worse than the Nazis.
Russians are not people, they are terrorists.

I call on everyone to obstruct and boycott Russia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º. Russian software. People from Russia.
For only the citizens of Russia are to blame for the deaths of tens of thousands of people. 75% of Russians support the war in Ukraine and the invasion of other European countries


Thanks to all countries for supporting Ukraine. Victory is ours!  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
